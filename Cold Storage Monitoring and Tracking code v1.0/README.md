LinkIt ONE reads the sensors data (Temperature and Humidity) along with the GPS co-ordinates, Battery Level and RTC Time.
Then it sends the sensor data, Battery level and GPS co-ordinates to PubNub.
Also the data is stored along with the RTC time in the 4GB MicroSD Card

Nodejs Server and Dashboard Code (v1.0):-
